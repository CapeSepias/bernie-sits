I'll flesh this out once i'm done stopping the site from crashing lol

To run, set the following environment variables
```
API_URL = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview'
KEY = 'YOUR-MAPS-STREETVIEW-KEY'
SECRET = 'YOUR-GOOGLE-SECRET'
```

You might wanna rename the variables to not conflict with existing ones.

Since the site is down now, you can also use `images.py` as a command-line bernie meme creation tool with:
```
python images.py 'FILENAME.jpg' 'LOCATION'
```
